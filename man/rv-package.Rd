\title{rv: Fast, Unified Project Management for R}
\description{
A productivity-focused R package manager inspired by Python's 'uv'. Provides a single interface to manage project dependencies using the 'DESCRIPTION' file as intent and 'renv.lock' as state. Automates the complexity of keeping manifests, installed packages, and lockfiles in sync with simple commands like init(), add(), remove(), and sync().
