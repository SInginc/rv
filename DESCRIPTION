Description: A productivity-focused R package manager inspired by Python's 'uv'.
    Provides a single interface to manage project dependencies using the
    'DESCRIPTION' file as intent and 'renv.lock' as state. Automates the
    complexity of keeping manifests, installed packages, and lockfiles in sync
    with simple commands like init(), add(), remove(), and sync().
